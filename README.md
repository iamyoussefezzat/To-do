💡 Usage

Open the app in your browser.

Use the input field to type a new task and click “Add” (or press Enter).

Once the task appears, you can click it (or a checkbox) to mark as done.

Use the delete icon (or button) beside a task to remove it.

Refresh the page — all tasks remain thanks to Local Storage.

Want to extend the app? Consider adding: categories, due dates, filters (all/done/active), drag-and-drop ordering.
